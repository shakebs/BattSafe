# Problem Statement
Most Battery Management Systems (BMS) rely only on temperature sensors for thermal protection. By the time a temperature alarm fires, the battery is already seconds away from failure. Research shows that thermal runaway follows a predictable cascade—gas venting and pressure changes occur minutes before the temperature spike.

Our system catches these earlier precursors at the edge, using a VSDSquadron ULTRA as a real-time multi-modal sensor fusion engine, to prevent thermal runaway, not just detect it.
